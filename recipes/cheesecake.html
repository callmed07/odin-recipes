        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h3>Our 5 ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>biscoff biscuits</li>
                    <li>double cream</li>
                    <li>full fat cream cheese</li>
                    <li>biscoff spread</li>
                </ul>
        
            <h3>For the base:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biscoff biscuits</strong> – We’re going to crush these up.</li>
                    <li><strong> Unsalted butter </strong> – Melt this quickly in a mug in the microwave.</li>
                </ul>


            <h3>For the cheesecake filling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> Double cream</strong> – See tips below on the required whipping consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong> Full fat cream cheese </strong> – I like to use Philadelphia brand cream cheese for this recipe. You can use other brands, but I find they are SLIGHTLY more difficult to combine.</li>
                    <li><strong> Biscoff spread </strong> - OBVIOUSLY!</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>For the topping:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biscoff spread</strong> – This will be very slightly melted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biscoff biscuits</strong> – Again, to be crushed.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>How to make Biscoff Cheesecake - steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the crushed biscuits and melted butter. Press the mixture into a tin and pop into the fridge to chill.</li>
            <li>Whisk the cream cheese, double cream and Biscoff spread together until very thick.</li>
            <li>Add the mixture to the base that’s been in the fridge. Refrigerate as per the recipe below.</li>
            <li>When almost ready to serve, melt the Lotus Biscoff spread gently in a pan or microwave. While still warm, pour over the cheesecake and smooth evenly. Crumble remaining biscuit over.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Whip the cream straight from the fridge (this helps to keep it stable) and whip enough so it holds its shape (to the texture of ice cream).</em></p>
